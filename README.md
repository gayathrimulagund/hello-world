Just another repository

Hi,

  My name is Gayathri Mulagund. I am a Civil Engineering graduate with over 12 years of experience, mostly in retail field. I am currently on a career break and wanted to explore Computer Science and coding. I felt the need to start from level and zero and CS50 seemed like an apt course. I am glad I initiated this. I hope to complete this to enrich my learning!
  
  Thank you for all those who are involved in developing and delivering this course. It is a wonderful opportunity for many of us to learn.
  
  Best regards
  Gayathri Mulagund
